# Project Name: Federated Disease Prediction System

## Overview
This project is a Federated Disease Prediction System that utilizes deep learning models to predict diseases based on medical images. It aggregates multiple models from various sources to create global models for enhanced accuracy and robustness. Additionally, it features a search bar functionality where users can input a location to retrieve a list of the top 20 hospitals nearby for testing related to their predicted disease.

## Features
1. **Deep Learning Models:** Incorporates deep learning models to predict diseases accurately from medical images.
   
2. **Model Aggregation:** Aggregates multiple models from different sources to create global models, improving prediction accuracy and reliability.
   
3. **Location-Based Hospital Search:** Offers a search bar where users can input their location to receive a list of the top 20 hospitals nearby for testing related to the predicted disease.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application using `python app.py`.
4. Run the frontend using  `npm start` in the Client directory in the ReactApp directory.

## Usage
1. Access the application through the provided URL.
2. Upload a medical image for disease prediction.
3. View the predicted disease results generated by the deep learning models.
4. Enter your location in the search bar to find the top 20 hospitals nearby for further testing and consultation.
