## Introduction

This repository contains a Federated Learning project focused on Alzheimer's Disease using a curated dataset. Alzheimer's Disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder, and this project aims to develop machine learning models that can predict, diagnose, or classify Alzheimer's based on medical data while preserving the privacy of the individuals in the dataset.

## Project Description

The project's primary goal is to create a Federated Learning system for Alzheimer's disease classification. Federated Learning is a decentralized approach to machine learning where the model is trained on the client's device, allowing sensitive medical data to remain local. The central server aggregates the models without accessing the raw data, thereby preserving privacy.

This project includes the following components:

1. Data Preprocessing: Preparing the Alzheimer's dataset for training, ensuring data consistency, and handling missing values.

2. Federated Learning Setup: Implementing a federated learning system where models are trained on client devices and aggregated on a central server.

3. Model Architecture: Experimenting with different machine learning models (e.g., deep neural networks, decision trees) for Alzheimer's classification.

4. Training and Evaluation: Training the models in a federated manner and evaluating their performance on various metrics.

5. Visualization: Visualizing the training progress and results.

## Requirements

Before getting started, ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch for deep learning models
- PySyft for federated learning
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for exploring notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adlard07/Federated-Learning.git
cd federated-learning-alzheimers
```

2. Set up your Python environment and install the required packages as mentioned in the Requirements section.

3. Start with the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder. They contain step-by-step explanations of data preprocessing, model creation, federated learning, and evaluation.

4. Modify the notebooks to experiment with different models, hyperparameters, and federated learning configurations.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is an Alzheimer's dataset that can be accessed from [source link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images). You should download and place the data in the `data` directory. The data includes various medical features and labels related to Alzheimer's diagnosis.

## Federated Learning

In the `federated_learning` directory, you will find code for setting up the federated learning environment. This includes defining the server and clients, specifying the communication protocols, and aggregating the models.

## Training

The `model_train.py` script provides a command-line interface for training federated learning models. You can specify the model architecture, training parameters, and other options.

Example usage:

```bash
python model_train.py --model cnn --epochs 10 --lr 0.001
```

## Evaluation

The `evaluate.py` script allows you to evaluate the trained models on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The project results and visualizations will be stored in the `results` directory. You can view training logs, model checkpoints, and performance visualizations there.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the federated learning approach for Alzheimer's classification or other enhancements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
